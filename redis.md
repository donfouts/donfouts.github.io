# azure cache for redis

my team found some problems with the inital impementation of redis cache in azure as a shared service, so the decision was made to continue with the individual application resource grouping. 
the pattern can been seen in the graphic from apim

redis caches are deployed with terraform when justification for use is provided
redis caches are initally provisioned as small as possible - until useage metrics can be gathered to justify increasing capibilities or feature sets of the redis SKU's.
